#### Languages used: 

HTML5, CSS3, Markdown

#### Description

This is a very simple site that consists of three different HTML pages, a css stylesheet and this readme markdown doc.

Each page conists of a nar bar connecting it to the other pages and a mix of different coding languages and main software tools used.
Each language tool has its logo and name underneath. Both the name and the logo are hyperlinked to the relevant wiki page about them.

After being written, all files got added and committed to Github with several edit versions.

The point of this mini project was to serve as an intro to several languages, tools and the core aspects of a basic webpage.
